- Translations stored in CSV format
- Custom classes and methods

### Future Plans
I'm currently refreshing and re-learning Japanese again, plus I also have a native language (Tagalog). When time permits, I also plan on adding Japanese and Tagalog translations along with the Spanish and French already defaulted on this project, as part of my Python app development practice.
