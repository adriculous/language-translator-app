# Language Translator App
My second Python project built as a class project provided by [Skillcrush](https://skillcrush.com).

The app contains the following:
- Basic Spanish and French translations
- Translations complied in a CSV file
- GUI module using the Remi Library

### Future Plans
I'm currently refreshing and re-learning Japanese again, plus I also have a native language (Tagalog). When time permits, I also plan on adding Japanese and Tagalog translations along with the Spanish and French already defaulted on this project, as part of my Python app development practice.
